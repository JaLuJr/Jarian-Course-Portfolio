        <h1>My Dev Tools Vandalism</h1>
        <p>
            I used browser developer tools to temporarily "vandalize" a
            website. Below is a screenshot showing my changes. These edits
            only appeared on my computer and did not affect the actual
            website.
        </p>
        <div class="screenshot-container">
            <!-- 
                IMPORTANT: Update the src attribute below to match your screenshot filename.
                Example: If your screenshot is named "apple-dot-com-but-with-papyrus-font.png", change the line to:

        <h2>What I "Vandalized"</h2>
        <p>
            I chose to vandalize the homepage of microsoft.com using my browser’s developer tools. It was surprisingly fun and gave me a deeper understanding of how websites are built and styled.
        <ul>
            <li>I found a promotional banner that originally said something like “Save up to $600.00” and changed it to something more playful: “Surface Laptop, Unicorns, and more” It instantly gave the page a whimsical twist and made me laugh.</li>
            <li>I used the Styles panel to change:

background-color to orange

border to 8px dashed teal

transform to rotate(+4deg) These changes made the banner look like it was tilted and taped onto the page with crayon scribbles. I also experimented with font size and color to exaggerate the headline.</li>
            <li>The contrast between Microsoft’s sleek, professional design and my goofy edits made it hilarious. It felt like sneaking a doodle into a corporate brochure.</li>
            <li>Yes! I learned that some elements are nested inside others, so changing one part didn’t always affect the whole section. I had to inspect the right <div> and sometimes manually add new styles to override existing ones.</li>
            <li>I wanted to exaggerate the seriousness of a corporate site with something lighthearted and absurd. The orange background and teal dashed border felt like a child’s drawing, which made the “Save $600” message feel like a lemonade stand deal.</li>
            <li>Definitely. I saw how HTML gives structure (like the <div> holding the banner) and CSS controls the appearance. Editing both helped me see how small tweaks can dramatically change a page’s vibe.</li>
            <li>Absolutely. Dev Tools feel like a live playground where I can test ideas instantly. I now feel more confident inspecting elements, trying out styles, and understanding how websites respond to changes.</li>
        </ul>
