                <h2>"Novacane" by Frank Ocean</h2>
                <p>This track has a freeing, floaty vibe that helps me mentally drift and reset. It’s like stepping outside the noise and finding stillness in motion.</p>
            </li>

                <h2>"Someone You Loved" by Lewis Capaldi</h2>
                <p>The emotional depth of this song helps me process my feelings and find solace.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h2>"Non-Stop" by the cast of Hamilton</h2>
                <p>This song fuels my drive — it makes me want to work, write, and push forward with the same relentless energy as Alexander Hamilton. It’s my productivity anthem.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h2>"As Long As I Have You" by Dove Cameron</h2>
                <p>Originally from <em>Liv and Maddie</em>, but this song stands on its own. It’s so emotional — it captures that ride-or-die feeling when your love for someone exceeds any worldly limitations. It reminds me that no matter what, love can be an anchor and a light.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h2>"Space Between" by Dove Cameron & Sofia Carson</h2>
                <p>This duet captures the ache and beauty of growing apart while still holding love. It speaks to the strength of connection even when distance or change enters the picture — a reminder that love can stretch across any space.</p>
